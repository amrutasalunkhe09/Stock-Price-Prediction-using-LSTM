# Stock-Price-Prediction-using-LSTM
Predict future stock prices using historical price data of Apple Inc. and perform risk analysis.

### Key Tasks:

  1. Collected and preprocessed historical stock price data using yfinance.

  2. Built an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model to forecast future stock prices.

  3. Evaluated the model using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and visualized predicted vs actual stock prices.

  4. Performed risk analysis using Value at Risk (VaR) for potential investment in the stock.

# Answered key financial questions like daily returns, moving averages, and stock price change over time.

### Techniques & Tools:

LSTM (Deep Learning)

MinMaxScaler for normalization

yfinance for stock data

TensorFlow/Keras for building the LSTM model

Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization

Scikit-learn for evaluation and data preprocessing
